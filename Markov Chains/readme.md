## Markov property: 
The Markov property states that the probability of a future state depends only on the current state, and not on any previous states. This means that the future is independent of the past.
## Stochasticity: 
Markov chains are stochastic, which means that the future is not predetermined. The probability of a future state can only be estimated, not known for certain.
Discrete time: Markov chains are discrete-time, which means that the state of the system changes at discrete intervals. This means that the system cannot change its state instantaneously.

Markov chains are used to model a wide variety of phenomena, including:

## Natural phenomena:
The spread of a virus, the weather, and the stock market are all examples of natural phenomena that can be modeled by Markov chains.
## Human behavior:
The behavior of individuals and groups can also be modeled by Markov chains. For example, Markov chains can be used to model the choices that people make in games, the way that people learn, and the way that people spread information.
## Computer science:
Markov chains are used in computer science for a variety of purposes, including:

## Text generation:
Markov chains can be used to generate text that is similar to a given piece of text.
## Speech recognition: 
Markov chains can be used to recognize speech.
## Machine learning: Markov chains can be used to train machine learning models.
